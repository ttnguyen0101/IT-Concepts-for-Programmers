## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
The components of the Information System in terms of an online Amazon purchase:
- Hardware: the phone I use to shop.
- Software: the Amazon Shopping app on my phone.
- Data: the information about my Amazon account (name, addresses), the information about the product I purchase (name of product, retailer, reviews).
- People: me as the customer, the retailer who sells me the product I need, Amazon developers who create the shopping app. 
- Process: looking through the search bar to find the product, putting it in the cart, checking out and processing the payment to achieve the goal of buying the product I need.

### Software
#### GitHub
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that acts as a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code, track and control changes to their code, and work with other developers on projects together from anywhere. 

GitHub employs a client-server network. GitHub acts as a central server that connects and allows its users to log into, post, and edit repositories from their PCs (the "client"). GitHub also employs cloud computing as this whole process can be done via the Internet and users are allowed to store their repositories directly on their GitHub accounts instead of their physical PCs. 
#### Screen Capture
- Soft ware utilized for screen capture: Window Snipping Tool
- File name: ScreenCapture.JPG
- File size: 128 KB
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
The roles of:
- Application Software: allows users to perform tasks (e.g. Microsoft Word allows for documenting and word processing, Excel allows for making spreadsheet).
- Utility Software: allows users to fix or modify computer in some way; created to fill shortcoming in operating systems (e.g. anti-malware software Norton).
- Operating System Software: provides the interface between the hardware and the Application software (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu Linux, Google Android, Apple iOS).
#### ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a business management software that integrates all facets of a company into a single database, application, and user interface, and allows it to implement the central database throughout the entire organization.
- ERP is an application that is used by many of an organization’s employees.
- All users of the ERP edit and save their information from the same data source.
- ERP systems include functionality that covers all the essential components of a business. 
- Example: Oracle ERP Cloud, BizAutomation, Oracle Netsuite ERP, etc.
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a computer or some other device. Its purpose is to:
- Allows a single physical computer to perform the functions of several virtual computers (Virtual Machines).
- Allows to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
- Reduces the number of physical servers needed to provide the necessary services to users.
- Reduces the demand for electricity to run and cool the physical servers.

A common IT problem solved by virtualization is operating system virtualization - it allows user to run different Operating Systems side-by-side to reduce bulk hardware costs, increase security, and limit time spent on IT services like software updates. 

The role of hypervisor in virtualization:
- Serve as the manager for the virtual environment.
- Separate the physical resources from the virtual environments.
- Partition the resources.
#### Python
Python is a high-level programming language that is simple yet powerful, easy to learn, free and open source, portable, interpreted, both object and procedure-oriented, extensible, embeddable, and has extensive libraries. It allows programmers to focus on solving problems rather than the syntax and structure of the language. 

Compiled language vs Interpreted language (Python):
- Compiled language (e.g. C, C++): before a program written in compiled language is run, it is first converted into binary code (in 0s and 1s) so the computer can understand using a compiler with various flags and options. When the program is run, the linker software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.
- Interpreted language: programs written in interpreted language do not need to be converted into binary code and are run directly from the source code. Internally, the source code is converted into an intermediate (bytecode) and translated into the native language of the computer. This allows for programs written in interpreted language to be more portable. 

Python1 is the screenshot of my experience with Python where I learn to print "Hello, MyName".

Python2 is the screenshot of a short program that adds two numbers written in Python.
#### Graphic Modeling and Rendering
Raster image is made of tiny pixels that become apparent when the image is enlarged, causing the image to lose its quality. Raster images are best used for photography or print materials. Vector image is not made of pixels, but scalable anchored dots and connected lines, therefore it does not lose quality when being enlarged or changing size. Vector images are best used for fonts, logos, digital printing, and 2D or 3D computer animation.

After a lossless compression, nothing in the original image is lost, and the compressed image will contain the same pixels as the original. After a lossy compression, the original image loses some pixels and even though the newly compressed image displays similarly, it is not the same as the original. It is important for web developers to know when to use which compression so that images on web pages can display appropriately on different browsers while not affecting the loading time.

The similarities and differences between jpg, gif, and png files:
Image type | Extension | Compression | Transparency | Animation | Colors
-|-|-|-|-|-|
GIF | .gif | Lossless | Yes | Yes | 256
JPG | .jpg or .jpeg | Lossy | No | No | Millions
PNG | .png | Lossless | Yes | No | Millions

#### File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to group multiple files into one single zip file. The zip file lowers the total file size as they are compressed, making it easier to transfer, upload, or download these files.

My original SVG graphic file is 97 KB in size. After being compressed, its zip file lowers to 53 KB in size. I would not expect there to be a big difference between a JPEG file and a zip file because some file formats, such as JPEG images and MP3s, are already compressed. These files can still be zipped, but the file size would not get much smaller. I tested this and confirmed that the difference between my original JPEG image and its zip file was only 1 KB.

#### Artificial Intelligence

#### Handshake
Handshake is a great tool beside LinkedIn that helps me create a professional online profile. It is also a great searching tool for internship, co-op, and job opportunities. It sends me notifications about any local hiring or meet and greet events. Despite not having much experience, there already are a few recruiters reaching out to my inbox about summer internship opportunities. I would love to add more to my Handshake profile as I progress through college.

I'm interested in the Programming & Development Associate Degree program from Tri-C. It is an Associate of Applied Business degree that prepares me to develop competencies in designing, implementing, integrating and maintaining software systems (including mainframes, websites, etc.) using a variety of languages and technologies. I'm also interested in obtaining a Data Analytics Certificate beside my associate degree. 
#### Industry Associations and Student Organizations
The ACM-W (Association for Computing Machinery-Women) is an organization that supports, celebrates, and advocates for Women in Computing. Its mission is to support, celebrate, and advocate internationally for the  full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women. As a member of the ACM, students would have access to tools and resources that help advance their knowledge about the industry and latest technology, access to a network of nearly 100,000 highly dedicated students and professional peers for networking, and unique volunteering opportunities to gain hands-on experience and knowledge of the marketplace. 

### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
Purpose of the CPU and the interaction of the ALU and CPU: 
- The purpose of the CPU (central processing unit) is to control all operations and data processing of the computer. It stores data, results, and instructions. The CPU has 3 components: memory unit, control unit, and arithmetic & logic unit.
- The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) performs mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logic operations (comparing, selecting, matching, merging data) inside the CPU. The ALU interacts with the control unit to process data. When there is a new input, the control gets instructions from the memory and sends them to the ALU to perform any operation accordingly. After the ALU performs its tasks, it sends the new output to the register for further use. 

How the example of using the self-checkout at the grocery store addresses the CPU, Input, and Output components: The information from the barcode on the grocery item is the input; the CPU is inside the self-checkout machine itself; the calculated price on the screen is the output. When the barcode on an item is scanned, its information inputs to the machine. After all the items are scanned, the CPU inside the machine performs mathematical operations that sum up the prices of all the items and calculate tax; it then displays the final charge as output on the screen. 

#### Gates and Circuits
What is meant by a truth table and how the AND gate truth table compares to that of an OR gate:
- Computers store information in the form of binary code by switching the electronic transistor on (to store 1) or off (to store 0). They use logic gates, building blocks of integrated circuits that take an input of 2 binary values and output a single binary value, to perform operations. There are 6 different types of logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR. The Truth Table represents the Boolean expression of a logic gate function. It shows each possible input combination to the gate or circuit with the resulting output.
- AND gate requires two outputs being True (or 1) for the output to be True (1). If two inputs are both False (0), or at least one of the inputs is False (0), its output will be False (0). Overall, the AND gate only has one True output from all four possible inputs. On the other hand, the OR gate only requires one of the two inputs being True (1) for the output to be True (1). It only has one False output from all four possible inputs.

#### IEEE
The purpose of the IEEE and their focus on ethics: The IEEE (Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is the world’s largest technical professional organization with the purpose of advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. It serves professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization. The IEEE’s approach to ethics in computing is to uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. Its members commit:
- to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, to protect the privacy of others, and to promptly disclose factors that might endanger the public or the environment.
- to improve the understanding by individuals and society of the capabilities and societal implications of conventional and emerging technologies, including intelligent systems.
- to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest whenever possible, and to disclose them to affected parties when they do exist.
- to avoid unlawful conduct in professional activities, and to reject bribery in all its forms.
- to seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors, to be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data, and to properly credit the contributions of others.
- to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations.

#### Storage
The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive: 
- The latency rate is the sum of seek time (the amount of time it takes a hard drive’s read/write head to find the physical location of a data on the disk) and rotational latency (the average time for the sector of the disk that is being accessed to rotate into position under the disk head after a completed seek). Latency is measured in millisecond (ms). The longer the latency, the slower the hard drive performance.
- The transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media. It is measured in megabytes per second (MBps). The higher the transfer rate, the higher the hard drive performance.

How a solid state drive (SSD) varies from a traditional hard drive: SSD stores data inside a solid state disk while traditional hard drive stores data inside a spinning disk. SSD uses flash memory instead of spinning disk; it uses Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) which has no latency issue associated with the spinning disk and is much faster. The SSD is much lighter, durable, and more efficient, however it is more expensive than the traditional hard drive.

#### Memory
Why increasing RAM impacts computing speed and the difference between 64- and 32-bit data paths:
- The CPU does not load data, programs, and instructions directly from the hard drive of the computer. Instead, when the computer is on, information from the hard drive is loaded into RAM (random access memory) before it is accessed by the CPU for further use. Increasing RAM allows the computer to have more data, programs, and instructions ready to be used, which results in faster computing speed.
- Data path is the number of bits of data being transferred in one clock cycle. A 64-bit data path can transfer 64 bits of data per cycle, while 32-bit can transfer 32. RAM speed is determined by its data path - the higher the number of bits per cycle, the faster the speed. 

2 difference between RAM and hard disk storage:
- RAM is the working memory that stores short-term data while the hard disk stores long term data.
- RAM storage is volatile and requires power - when the computer is off, all its data is wiped away. Hard disk storage is non-volatile and does not require power - its data is not erased even when the computer is off. Computer stores data in the hard drive when it is off, and retrieves data from the hard drive when it is on. 

#### Data Representation
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representation:
- Decimal is a base-10 numbering system where each column represents a power of 10. It has 10 digits from 0-9.
- Binary is a base-2 numbering system where each column represents a power of 2. It has 2 digits, 1 and 0.
- Hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system where each column represents a power of 16. It has both numbers from 0-9 and alphabetical characters from A-F.

4BinaryConversion.png: convert binary number 10001101 to decimal.

Explanation of the representation #ab0fff: Colors on web page are coded in #RRGGBB which specifies the intensity of red, green, and blue in a color. The intensity ranges from 0-255 in decimal or from 0-FF in hexadecimal (FF in hexadecimal is 255 in decimal). The color #ab0fff has these attributes:

Color | Code | Decimal | Intensity Percent
-|-|-|-|
Red | ab | 171 | 67.1%
Green | 0f | 15 | 5.9%
Blue | ff | 255 | 100%

Considering accessibility in websites, the color coded #ab0fff (vivid violet) can be problematic if used with these colors as people with color vision deficiency cannot tell them apart: dark gray, desaturated dark violet, pure blue, strong blue, dark grayish red, bright blue, and dark moderate magenta. Color contrast should be considered to increase accessibility. According to the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), the contrast level between text and its background should be 4.5:1 for most text and 3:1 for large text. The difference in grade between any two colors should be at least 40 to ensure enough contrast for accessibility. 

#### Operating Systems
On my Windows PC, I get access to the operating system command prompt by typing “cmd” in the search bar. After the command prompt shows up on my screen, I type “cd” followed by the address of the designated location where I want my new folder to be. Once there, I type “mkdir IT1025” to create the new folder. I check to see whether the new folder was created by typing “dir” in the command prompt which shows all the files and folders in the current directory I am in. 

### Networking
#### Data Transmission
- Packet: Unit of data
- Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address
- IP Address: Unique identifying number
- DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
- Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate
#### Hardware
a. The benefit of a switch over a hub is its ability to detect specific devices that are connected to it, to learn the physical addresses of these devices, and store their MAC addresses in its table. This ability of the switch reduces unnecessary traffic of data transmission on the bandwidth and increases security. 

b. The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is its ability to read I.P addresses which allows it to connect and exchange data over the Internet with different networks instead of only the local ones. While hubs and switches are used to create local networks, routers are used to connect different networks. It acts as the gateway of a network where it routes or forwards data from one network to another based on their I.P addresses.
#### Topologies and Types of Networks
a. Single point of failure is a flaw in the design in which a single malfunction or fault causes the whole system to stop working. The topologies that experience this issue are star topology, ring topology, and bus topology. 
- In star topology, if the central hub or switch fails, all the computers connected to that central point would also fail, causing the entire network to go down.
- In ring topology, if one of the computers in the network goes down, or if there was a single break on the cable, all the data flow would be disrupted and the whole network would go down.
- In bus topology, if there was a single open connection on either end of the cable, the data would not be transferred, causing the networking to go down.

b. Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh are similar in a sense that they are both the combination of wired and wireless devices. Infrastructure topology works better in small areas or buildings such as small rooms, small houses, coffee shops, etc. as these areas do not require a lot of wireless access points. Wireless Mesh works better in large buildings with different floors as setting up a wired topology in this case would require a lot of cables.
#### Network Design
NetworkDesign.jpeg: a combination of infrastructure and wireless mesh topology. The printer, PC, and WAP are physically connected to the router (infrastructure). The laptop is connected to the network via the WAP (wireless mesh). 

#### Protocols
A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols perform one of the three primary actions:
1. Communication: allow different network devices to communicate with each other (e.g. routing, Bluetooth, file transfer, etc.)
2. Network management: define and describe the various procedures needed to effectively operate a computer network (e.g. connection, link aggregation, troubleshooting).
3. Security: ensure that the network and the data sent over the protocols are protected from unauthorized users (e.g. encryption, entity authentication, transportation).

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to view web pages on the Internet. It is an example of the client-server model. When you type in a web address on your computer (client), HTTP is used to retrieve this web page from the web server and load it on the screen of your computer. All information is sent over the internet from your computer to the web server and back. 
Secure HTTP uses 2 protocols to protect data:
1. Secure socket layer (SSL): use public key encryption to secure data. SSL certificate is used to authenticate the identity of a website.
2. Transport layer security (TLS): the latest industry standard cryptographic protocol that is based on the same specification as SSL; authenticates server, client, and encrypts data using public key encryption. 
#### IP Address
Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) that is connected to the Internet. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) uses 32-bit (binary digit) addressing which consists of decimal number in the format of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, in which each xxx is a value from 0 to 255; it can offer 4 billions possible addresses. IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) lengthens from 32 bits to 128 bits, and consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by a semicolon; it can offer up to 3.4 x 1038 possible addresses.
#### ICANN
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names & Numbers (ICANN) is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). It allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR) around the world based on globally agreed-upon rules and policies. The RIRs then allocate smaller IP address blocks to Internet Service Providers (ISP) and other network operators, which then assign individual connections to customers. 

### Cybersecurity and Encryption
#### Security Triad
The Security Triad consists of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The impact each component has on the approach of online medical records such as MyChart is:
- Confidentiality: access to medical records is restricted to only those who are allowed to see it, such as the patients and their specific healthcare providers.
- Integrity: information on the medical record is not altered and truly represents its intended meaning.
- Availability: information can be accessed and modified by anyone authorized to do so in an appropriate time frame. 

#### Caesar and Polyalphabetic Ciphers
Message: "Tri-C has a Cybersecurity Certificate"
- Caesar Cipher encryption: tke jcu c eadgtugewtkva egtvkhkecvg
- Polyalphabetic Cipher encryption with shift word “n”: hfwq vog o qmpsfgsqifwhm qsfhwtwqohs

Using Caesar Cipher encryption, the message is applied a shift of three to each letter in the original, so A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on. Using Polyalphabetic Cipher encryption, a shift with a particular shift word (“n” in this case) is applied to the message; the words are converted into numbers according to the letter position in the alphabet, then each letter in the message is encrypted by shifting according to the number below it. 

#### Public and Private Key Encryption
In public key encryption, two keys are used: a public key and a private key. To send an encrypted message, you obtain the public key, encode the message, and send it. The recipient then uses their private key to decode it. The public key can be given to anyone who wishes to send the recipient a message. Each user simply needs one private key and one public key in order to secure messages. The private key is necessary in order to decrypt a message sent with the public key.

#### Brute-Force Attacks
There are several methods that can be implemented to protect against brute force attacks.

For Users:
- Use long, unique passwords.
- Secure remote desktop connections by leaving it off as much as possible.
- Use 2-Factor Authentication to log into accounts.

For Server Operators:
- Use rate limiting to delay hackers from trying passwords very fast.
- Don’t use account lockouts to prevent hackers from performing a denial of service attack that locks out lots of accounts.
- Secure SSH (Secure Shell) appropriately by enabling fail2ban, disabling password logins (in favor of SSH keys), and turning off root login from SSH.
- Hash and salt your passwords with modern algorithms. 

### Internet Programming
#### Components of a URL
- Scheme = https
- Domain = www.amazon.com
- Top level domain = .edu
- Default page = no file path provided
- Parameters = result of search
- Anchor = specific location on a page

#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web in 1989 to share information over the Internet in a simple way. In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which took a role in developing recommendations and prototypes for the Web technologies, creating web architecture, standards for web designs, and accessibility. 
The Web of Devices standard created by the W3C focuses on technology that enables Web access anywhere, anytime, using any device. It promotes creating “One Web” that is available on any device and ensures the best user experience on mobile devices, taking into account device capabilities, location, and other context information. It promotes creating websites compatible with Voice Browsing features using the Speech Interface Framework. It also promotes Device Independence and Content Adaptation as devices come in many shapes, capabilities and sizes which define constraints on the content these devices can handle. Furthermore, it urges websites to have Multimodal Access because interactions with devices do not only happen with a keyboard, but also through voice, touch, and gesture. Last but not least, the Web of Devices standard promotes the connection of Web and TV as TVs are becoming more interactive with rich applications that are partly based on Web technologies. 


### Software Development
#### Algorithms
Variables are locations in the computer’s memory where you can store a single value. In hello.py program, I created 2 new variables called myName and myAge.

Assignment statement is used to store values in variables; it consists of a variable name, an equal sign (assignment operator), and the value to be stored. In hello.py program, I assign the input from the keyboard to be the value for the variable myName using the assignment statement myName = input().

Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. In hello.py program, I use the print() function to print out text lines on the screen.

Three data types:
- Integer: whole numbers
- Floating-point: numbers with decimal points.
- String: texts or characters. 

#### Object Oriented Concepts
- The attributes of the shark class are self, name, and age.
- The shark class has two methods or functions, one for swimming and another for being awesome.
- The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data and run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
- A class is like a blueprint while an object is the actual creation from the blueprint. To “instantiate an object from a class” means to create an object that has certain attributes and functions from the class. In other terms, if the class is the recipe, then its object is the cake. 

- I used the commands sammy = Shark(), stevie = Shark(), and thu = Shark() to instantiate an object from the Shark class. The instantiated objects of the Shark class are sammy, stevie, and thu.
- In OOP, inheritance is when the child class receives all the attributes, methods, and behaviors of its parent class. In Shark.py, sammy, stevie, and thu all inherit the attributes and functions defined in the Shark class. 
##### UML
The Shark class diagram contains its attributes and methods. It has one private attribute which is name. It has two public methods which are swim() and be_awesome().

### Database Systems
#### SQL, NoSQL, and Big Data Technologies
- Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language that is used to analyze and manipulate relational data; it can be embedded in many computer languages that are used to develop platform-independent web-based applications; it is record-locking in which only one person be able to manipulate a piece of data at a time; it does not scale well. 
- NoSQL (“not only SQL”) is a language that can work with data in a looser way comparing to SQL, allowing for a more unstructured environment, communicating changes to the data over time to all the servers that are part of the database; it arises from the need to solve the problem of large-scale databases spread over several servers or even across the world; it is not record-locking like SQL, and it scales better than SQL. 

The four “Vs” of Big Data: 
1. Volume -refers to the size of the data.
2. Variety - refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured.
3. Velocity - refers to the speed of generation of data.
4. Variability - refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times, thus hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.

The demand for Big Data is driven by DMBS, social data from search engines and sites (such as Facebook, Twitter), stock exchanges, jet engines, etc.
#### Data and Business Decisions
In this scenario, I am part of an IT team at a game company which wants to design a database to keep track of individual games and their authors. A well-designed database would:
- Keep track of the games and their authors.
- Show which game has a high volume of sale so the company knows which game genre to invest more in the future.
- Show how much each author is earned in royalty based on the game he/she designs so the company can determine the payroll. 

All the fields to be used in each table are:
- GAME (GAME ID, NAME, VERSION NUMBER, AUTHOR ID, CATEGORY CODE)
- AUTHOR (AUTHOR ID, NAME, MAILING ADDRESS, E-MAIL ADDRESS)
- CATEGORY (CATEGORY CODE, DESCRIPTION)
- ROYALTY (AUTHOR ID, GAME ID, ROYALTY PERCENTAGE)

#### The Relational Model and Normalization
In the tables developed above:
- Primary key is used as unique identifier for the record. In this case, it is the Game ID.
- Foreign key is used to implement a relationship between 2 tables by connecting the primary key data from another table. In this case, CATEGORY CODE is the foreign key in the GAME table. 
- Normalization reduces data redundancy and ensures data integrity. In this case, the tables contain fields that are not repeated.

#### SQL Injections

### Legal and Ethical Responsibilities in Computing

## Conclusion
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

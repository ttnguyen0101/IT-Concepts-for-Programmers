## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
The components of the Information System in terms of an online Amazon purchase:
- Hardware: the phone I use to shop.
- Software: the Amazon Shopping app on my phone.
- Data: the information about my Amazon account (name, addresses), the information about the product I purchase (name of product, retailer, reviews).
- People: me as the customer, the retailer who sells me the product I need, Amazon developers who create the shopping app. 
- Process: looking through the search bar to find the product, putting it in the cart, checking out and processing the payment to achieve the goal of buying the product I need.

### Software
#### GitHub
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that acts as a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code, track and control changes to their code, and work with other developers on projects together from anywhere. 

GitHub employs a client-server network. GitHub acts as a central server that connects and allows its users to log into, post, and edit repositories from their PCs (the "client"). GitHub also employs cloud computing as this whole process can be done via the Internet and users are allowed to store their repositories directly on their GitHub accounts instead of their physical PCs. 
#### Screen Capture
- Soft ware utilized for screen capture: Window Snipping Tool
- File name: ScreenCapture.JPG
- File size: 128 KB
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
The roles of:
- Application Software: allows users to perform tasks (e.g. Microsoft Word allows for documenting and word processing, Excel allows for making spreadsheet).
- Utility Software: allows users to fix or modify computer in some way; created to fill shortcoming in operating systems (e.g. anti-malware software Norton).
- Operating System Software: provides the interface between the hardware and the Application software (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu Linux, Google Android, Apple iOS).
#### ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a business management software that integrates all facets of a company into a single database, application, and user interface, and allows it to implement the central database throughout the entire organization.
- ERP is an application that is used by many of an organization’s employees.
- All users of the ERP edit and save their information from the same data source.
- ERP systems include functionality that covers all the essential components of a business. 
- Example: Oracle ERP Cloud, BizAutomation, Oracle Netsuite ERP, etc.
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a computer or some other device. Its purpose is to:
- Allows a single physical computer to perform the functions of several virtual computers (Virtual Machines).
- Allows to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
- Reduces the number of physical servers needed to provide the necessary services to users.
- Reduces the demand for electricity to run and cool the physical servers.

A common IT problem solved by virtualization is operating system virtualization - it allows user to run different Operating Systems side-by-side to reduce bulk hardware costs, increase security, and limit time spent on IT services like software updates. 

The role of hypervisor in virtualization:
- Serve as the manager for the virtual environment.
- Separate the physical resources from the virtual environments.
- Partition the resources.
#### Python
Python is a high-level programming language that is simple yet powerful, easy to learn, free and open source, portable, interpreted, both object and procedure-oriented, extensible, embeddable, and has extensive libraries. It allows programmers to focus on solving problems rather than the syntax and structure of the language. 

Compiled language vs Interpreted language (Python):
- Compiled language (e.g. C, C++): before a program written in compiled language is run, it is first converted into binary code (in 0s and 1s) so the computer can understand using a compiler with various flags and options. When the program is run, the linker software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.
- Interpreted language: programs written in interpreted language do not need to be converted into binary code and are run directly from the source code. Internally, the source code is converted into an intermediate (bytecode) and translated into the native language of the computer. This allows for programs written in interpreted language to be more portable. 

Python1 is the screenshot of my experience with Python where I learn to print "Hello, MyName".

Python2 is the screenshot of a short program that adds two numbers written in Python.

#### Handshake
Handshake is a great tool beside LinkedIn that helps me create a professional online profile. It is also a great searching tool for internship, co-op, and job opportunities. It sends me notifications about any local hiring or meet and greet events. Despite not having much experience, there already are a few recruiters reaching out to my inbox about summer internship opportunities. I would love to add more to my Handshake profile as I progress through college. 
#### Certifications, Certificates, and Degrees

### Computer Architecture
#### CPU
The purpose of the CPU (central processing unit) is to control all operations and data processing of the computer. It stores data, results, and instructions. The CPU has 3 components: memory unit, control unit, and arithmetic & logic unit. The ALU (arithmetic logic unit) performs mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logic operations (comparing, selecting, matching, merging data) inside the CPU. The ALU interacts with the control unit to process data. When there is a new input, the control gets instructions from the memory and sends them to the ALU to perform any operation accordingly. After the ALU performs its tasks, it sends the new output to the register for further use. 

How the example of using the self-checkout at the grocery store addresses the CPU, Input, and Output components: The information from the barcode on the grocery item is the input; the CPU is inside the self-checkout machine itself; the calculated price on the screen is the output. When the barcode on an item is scanned, its information inputs to the machine. After all the items are scanned, the CPU inside the machine performs mathematical operations that sum up the prices of all the items and calculate tax; it then displays the final charge as output on the screen. 
#### Gates and Circuits
Computers store information in the form of binary code by switching the electronic transistor on (to store 1) or off (to store 0). They use logic gates, building blocks of integrated circuits that take an input of 2 binary values and output a single binary value, to perform operations. There are 6 different types of logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR. The Truth Table represents the Boolean expression of a logic gate function. It shows each possible input combination to the gate or circuit with the resulting output.
#### IEEE
IEEE (Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is the world’s largest technical professional organization with the purpose of advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. It serves professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization. The IEEE’s approach to ethics in computing is to uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. Its members commit:
- to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, to strive to comply with ethical design and sustainable development practices, to protect the privacy of others, and to promptly disclose factors that might endanger the public or the environment.
- to improve the understanding by individuals and society of the capabilities and societal implications of conventional and emerging technologies, including intelligent systems.
- to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest whenever possible, and to disclose them to affected parties when they do exist.
- to avoid unlawful conduct in professional activities, and to reject bribery in all its forms.
- to seek, accept, and offer honest criticism of technical work, to acknowledge and correct errors, to be honest and realistic in stating claims or estimates based on available data, and to properly credit the contributions of others.
- to maintain and improve our technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations.

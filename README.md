## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

### Information System Components
The components of the Information System in terms of an online Amazon purchase:
- Hardware: the phone I use to shop.
- Software: the Amazon Shopping app on my phone.
- Data: the information about my Amazon account (name, addresses), the information about the product I purchase (name of product, retailer, reviews).
- People: me as the customer, the retailer who sells me the product I need, Amazon developers who create the shopping app. 
- Process: looking through the search bar to find the product, putting it in the cart, checking out and processing the payment to achieve the goal of buying the product I need.

### Software
#### GitHub
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that acts as a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code, track and control changes to their code, and work with other developers on projects together from anywhere. 

GitHub employs a client-server network. GitHub acts as a central server that connects and allows its users to log into, post, and edit repositories from their PCs (the "client"). GitHub also employs cloud computing as this whole process can be done via the Internet and users are allowed to store their repositories directly on their GitHub accounts instead of their physical PCs. 
#### Screen Capture

- File name: ScreenCapture.JPG
- File size: 128 KB
#### Application, Utility, and Operating Systems
The roles of:
- Application Software: allows users to perform tasks (e.g. Microsoft Word allows for documenting and word processing, Excel allows for making spreadsheet).
- Utility Software: allows users to fix or modify computer in some way; created to fill shortcoming in operating systems (e.g. anti-malware software Norton).
- Operating System Software: provides the interface between the hardware and the Application software (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu Linux, Google Android, Apple iOS).
#### ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a business management software that integrates all facets of a company into a single database, application, and user interface, and allows it to implement the central database throughout the entire organization.
- ERP is an application that is used by many of an organization’s employees.
- All users of the ERP edit and save their information from the same data source.
- ERP systems include functionality that covers all the essential components of a business. 
- Example: Oracle ERP Cloud, BizAutomation, Oracle Netsuite ERP, etc.
#### Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of using software to simulate a computer or some other device. Its purpose is to:
- Allows a single physical computer to perform the functions of several virtual computers (Virtual Machines).
- Allows to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
- Reduces the number of physical servers needed to provide the necessary services to users.
- Reduces the demand for electricity to run and cool the physical servers.

A common IT problem solved by virtualization is operating system virtualization - it allows user to run different Operating Systems side-by-side to reduce bulk hardware costs, increase security, and limit time spent on IT services like software updates. 

The role of hypervisor in virtualization:
- Serve as the manager for the virtual environment.
- Separate the physical resources from the virtual environments.
- Partition the resources.
#### Python
Python is a high-level programming language that is simple yet powerful, easy to learn, free and open source, portable, interpreted, both object and procedure-oriented, extensible, embeddable, and has extensive libraries. It allows programmers to focus on solving problems rather than the syntax and structure of the language. 

Compiled language vs Interpreted language (Python):
- Compiled language (e.g. C, C++): before a program written in compiled language is run, it is first converted into binary code (in 0s and 1s) so the computer can understand using a compiler with various flags and options. When the program is run, the linker software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.
- Interpreted language: programs written in interpreted language do not need to be converted into binary code and are run directly from the source code. Internally, the source code is converted into an intermediate (bytecode) and translated into the native language of the computer. This allows for programs written in interpreted language to be more portable. 

Python1 is the screenshot of my experience with Python where I learn to print "Hello, MyName".

Python2 is the screenshot of a short program that adds two numbers written in Python.
